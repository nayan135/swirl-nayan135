                <h2>My Journey</h2>
                <p>Namaste! I'm Nayan Acharya from Kathmandu, Nepal. My fascination with coding began unexpectedly in
                    2021 when a friend challenged me to build a simple website. What started as curiosity quickly became
                    a genuine passion after I saw my first
                    HTML page come to life.</p>

                <p>The year 2022 marked a turning point when I chose to pursue Computer Engineering despite my parents
                    initially hoping I'd follow a more traditional path. That same year, I stumbled upon GitHub after a
                    frustrating experience losing all my
                    code to a corrupted drive – a lesson I'll never forget!</p>

                <p>By mid-2023, I'd grown ambitious enough to tackle full-stack projects, learning through countless
                    late nights and debugging sessions. All the hard work culminated in achieving a 3.72 GPA in my SEE
                    exams, which opened doors I never thought
                    possible.
                </p>

                <p>Today, having completed Grade 11, I'm balancing my studies with a leadership role at YPSTEM while
                    working on my side project – a platform connecting rural Nepali students with tech education
                    resources. I believe technology should serve
                    everyone, not just those in cities with easy access.</p>
